It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.\n- **Receiver**: The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.\n- **Transmission Medium**: The transmission is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver. Ex: twisted pair, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves.\n- **Protocol**: A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications.

Local communication usually occurs face to face, while remote takes place over distance.\n- Information is always in terms of **DATA**.\n- **Data** refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by parties creating and using the data.\n- **Data communication** is the exchange of data between devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable.\n- Communication devices must be part of a communication system made up of a combination of hardware and software. Effectiveness of data communication depends upon four fundamental characteristics:\n    - **Delivery**: The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Data must be received by the intended device or user.\n    - **Accuracy**: The system must deliver data accurately. Data that have been altered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable.\n    - **Timeliness**: The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delivered late are unusable, in the same order that they are produced, and without significant delay. This kind of delivery is called **real-time transmission**.\n    - **Jitter**: Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. It is the uneven delay in the delivery of audio and video packets.\n\n---\n*End of Document*\n---\n```",

This means that individual packets may take different paths to reach the same destination.\n- Difference:\n    - TCP/IP combines the presentation and session layer issues into its application layer.\n    - TCP/IP combines the OSI data link and physical layers into the network access layer.\n    - TCP/IP appears simple because it has fewer layers.\n    - TCP/IP protocols are the standards around which the internet developed, so the TCP/IP model gains credibility just because of its protocol.\n```",
